# GupShupIndia - Real-time Chat Application

Hello team,

I trust this message finds you well. I appreciate the opportunity to work on the task of developing a real-time chat application using Node.js. I've completed the task and would like to share an overview of the work, technologies used, and insights into the development process.

**App Link:** [GupShupIndia](https://chatapp-weld-three.vercel.app/)

## Summary:
I've created GupShupIndia, a chat application with the following features:

- User authentication
- Message encryption using public and private keys
- Sending text messages and images
- Real-time chat functionality
- Storing messages and user data in MongoDB
- End-to-end encryption for secure communication

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI, React Router
- **Backend:** Express, Node.js, Socket.io
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Render (backend), Vercel (frontend)

## Features:
- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- Secure storage of the user's private key in local storage
- Real-time chat with encryption using tweetnacl library
- Storing public keys on MongoDB for secure message decryption
- Minimal error handling (room for improvement)
- Image storage on the server (can be improved using cloud storage)

## Challenges and Learning:
- Learning socket.io for real-time communication
- Implementing a combination of socket.io and MongoDB for message storage
- Message encoding and decoding with public and private keys
- Managing friend lists and user IDs
- Limited testing due to time constraints

I acknowledge areas for improvement, such as error handling, UI design, and image storage, which can be addressed in future iterations.

Attached to this message is a detailed document providing more information about the project, including its architecture. I hope this document offers insight into the development process and decisions made.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or need clarification. I look forward to your feedback and potential next steps.

Thank you once again for the opportunity.

Best regards,
